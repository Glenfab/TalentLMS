    <summary><strong>🗂️ Scenario 2: Missing Documentation, Billing Delay</strong></summary>

    ✅ If the chart was marked as complete<br>
    <em>Billing can’t proceed without this confirmation and provider sign-off.</em></p>

    <p><strong>✔ Who should be looped in?</strong><br>
    ✅ Dentist<br>
    <em>Only the provider can complete and sign the documentation.</em></p>

    <p><strong>✔ Which zone stabilizes the situation?</strong><br>
    ✅ Zone 1 (Front Office Team)<br>
    <em>They’re closest to the disruption and can act fast.</em></p>

    ✅ Route calls to voicemail temporarily<br>
    <em>Saves real-time bandwidth for patients who are physically present.</em></p>
